# charity-funding-predictor

This repository contains a machine learning model attempting to determine if the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup can choose applicants to fund with high chances of success. A neural network machine learning model was designed using a dataset from Alphabet Soup applicants and trained with a goal of 75% accuracy.

### Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Sci-kit Learn
- Tensorflow

### Report

#### Overview

This analysis was performed to attempt to optimize the model to atleast 75% accuracy at predicting successful applicants

#### Results

##### Data Preprocessing

- The target variable for the model was determined to be the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column
- The features used to train the model were the remaining columns minus a couple of columns that were removed which is explained below
- The "EIN" and "NAME" columns were removed since they provided no numerical data and were simply identifying columns

##### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model

- My baseline model was designed using 3 different layers (2 hidden and 1 output layer). The hidden layers used the relu activation function and had 80 and 30 neurons while the output layer used sigmoid activation function with 1 neuron.
- This initial model was just under the intended 75% accuracy.

- 3 different attempts were made to increase the accuracy but none of them were considered a success with no-minimal accuracy improvement

1. Dropped ASK_AMT column to limit the number of variables in the dataset

2. Added another hidden layer with 30 neurons

3. Tried the tanh activation function instead of the relu activation function
